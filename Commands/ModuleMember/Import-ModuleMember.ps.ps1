    .SYNOPSIS
        Imports members into a module
    .DESCRIPTION
        Imports members from an object into a module.
        
        A few types of members can easily be turned into commands:
        * A ScriptMethod with named blocks
        * A Property with a ScriptBlock value
        * A Property with a relative path
         
        Each of these can easily be turned into a function or alias.
